# Learning docker

Hello, I'm writing a book about docker.

It's in a very early stage right now.

All (or almost all examples) are tested on a vagrant box with Vagrantfile
provided with this repository.

This box is fairly simple and doesn't have docker installed.
It has to be done manually now, but maybe I will automate it later.

If you have vagrant installed you can start a vagrant box with:

```
$ vagrant up
```

And later ssh to it with

```
$ vagrant ssh
```
